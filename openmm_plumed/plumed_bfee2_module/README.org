The QUATERNION.cpp has been implemented by Poker Chen and the original code is
on [[https://github.com/zharmad/plumed2/blob/orient-q/src/colvar/Quaternion.cpp][GitHub]].
It is the equivalent of the Colvars Orientation CV. Also, we have implemented the `DISTANCEDIR` CV.

** How to complie
After you download the Plumed files before compiling, do the followings.

- Copy bfee2 folder to Plumed_Dir/src
Then complie plumed with the bfee2 module enaabled
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./configure  --prefix=$HOME/local/plumed -disable-mpi --disable-gsl --enable-modules=bfee2
#+END_SRC

Note: If you installed py-plumed using Conda, it automatically installs plumed. You must uninstall the plumed package first
by doing "conda remove --force plumed".
