The QUATERNION.cpp has been implemented by Poker Chen and the original code is
on [[https://github.com/zharmad/plumed2/blob/orient-q/src/colvar/Quaternion.cpp][GitHub]].
It is the equivalent of the Colvars Orientation CV. There was a bug in reading the input files,
and I fixed it.

** How to use
After you download the Plumed files before compiling, do the followings.

- Copy QUATERNION.cpp to PlumedPath/src/colvar
- Copy Vector.h to src/tools

Note: If you installed py-plumed using Conda, it automatically installs plumed. You must uninstall the plumed package first
by doing "conda remove --force plumed".
